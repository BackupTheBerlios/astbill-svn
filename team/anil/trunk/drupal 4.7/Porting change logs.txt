Porting Instructions:

UPGRADE of Existing astbill installations is NOT recommended and also MAY not be possible.

There is lot of information at www.drupal.org regarding porting to 4.7 version.
Most importantly is the information relating to Form API.


Mysql charset:

drupal 4.7 now uses utf8 charset.
converted astbill to use utf8  charset.
This charset may break existing installations.




Porting notes:

1) removed table sort function references.
2) object2array in astcontact.module needs to be changed to array ??? maybe a new port allready exists on drupal.
3) Convert all form_* to new API format. (run it in the form updater)
4) Fieldset seems to be not compatible in drupal 4.7. (this is out of my league, any one able to help ??)
5) When creating astbill_views.sql file. asvaccount & asvaccount2 should be placed after asvaccuser (must).
6) asvprice_uk, asvprice_uk_all, asvprice_usa needs removal, these seems specific to astartelecom site
