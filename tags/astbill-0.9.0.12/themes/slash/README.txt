Drupal slash theme:
------------------
Author - Fredrik Jonsson <fredrik at combonet dot se>
Requires - Drupal 4.6
License - GPL (see LICENSE)


Overview:
--------
The Slash theme is originally from Slashcode
<http://www.slashcode.com/>. I found a version for PHP-Nuke that I later
converted to Postnuke and now to Drupal. See it in action at my site
xdeb.org <http://xdeb.org/>.

The main style is dark red and there are additional styles that are,
black, blue (MacSlash) and green (Slashdot).

Tables are used for the three column layout, the main header and 
the header for nodes and boxes. For the rest CSS is used.

Install:
-------
1. Create a directory /slash/ under your /themes/ directory
2. Copy all files and dirs to /themes/slash/ directory
3. Enable the theme in "administer > configuration > themes" page


Compatibility:
-------------
Theme has been tested using:
- Safari 1.2.x (KHTML)
- Mozilla 1.7.x (Gecko)

I guess it works with Internet Explorer but I can't say I care one way
or another.
