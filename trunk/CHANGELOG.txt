01 Dec 2006
# Implemented the last View performance strategy in MyAdmin and compleete AstBill. AstBill can now handle
# millions of records without constrains.

16 Nov 2006
# Implementet new Price List structure. Price List are now based on
# CCN = Charge Code Numbers
# We have different tables for countrycode, language, Dial Prefix (Pattern) and Rates
# The old Price List structure still exist but may be depriciated in future versions.

14 Oct 2006
# Modified DBI->connect in Perl Script agi-bin
# This allows use of remote server not only localhost
# Still under testing

23 Sept 2006 Version 0.9.18
# Improved performanse of astpbx.module. Subscription can now handle millions of records
# Performance have changed from 12 seconds to 1 seconds on a setup with nearly a million cdr records
# The same Improvement will have to be done in MyAdmin
# Added astglobal.module. This allow you to create accounts and partners and show customer status even under a multi site setup.
# Remember to update your site list in table astacgroup WHERE mastergroup = 'Site'
# Added astcdr.callstatus to database. This field is 1 if this is a valid PSTN call. This improve performance by 10000%
# The reason for that is that we can SELECT WHERE callstatus = 1 and not 
# `astcdr`.`dialstatus` like 'ANSWER%' and `astcdr`.`answeredtime` <> 0 and `astcdr`.`trunk` <> 'Local'
#  Created a LOG system for database updates. This allows tracking of who changed what in each table. astcore_astlogdb
#

09 April 2006 Version 0.9.18  (Not Published as bz2 - SVN only)
# New Partner Admin Module
# This allow you to see accounts and users linked to this Partner (Tenant if you prefeer) :-)
# Updated Payment module. Added read bank file for Norwegian banks. Other bank formats will be added
# Updated payment_status field. If value = 'FP' the invoice/payment is linked and marked as FULLY PAID
#

09 April 2006 Version 0.9.17  (Not Published as bz2 - SVN only)

# Fatal error: Call to undefined function: array2uri()
#
# Problem with modules: There are two new modules astcore.module and astsettingsdid.module
# If you are upgrading you will have problem loading your application before this modules are activated.
# You must activate the astcore.module and astsettingsdid.module by going direct to:

http://yoursite.com/astbill/?q=admin/modules

# Added table astpartner
# Partners are tenants, customers, suppliers or prospects. 
# We create one record per company but (Not Implemented yet) many contact persons (address, email, ...) 
# can be created for the same partner. Partner is also a department contact of the main company or even a branch. 
# The partners are segmented into several categories. 
# The events history (sales, purchase, help desk, ...) of a partner will be logged.
# The asttenant and astcompany table will be depriciated. It will all be one astpartner. This will allow us to
# Develop a powerfull CRM, Purchasing and Call Center application in the future. Any sugestions are welcome.
# This is only partly implemented in this version of AstBill. 
#
# Added SMS Module with SMS logging
#
# Perfect Search
# Astbill now have an exelent search API working extreemly fast even with 100 000 records in the database.
# The search button will come up on top of the table view and will retain the search results even if you do any type of 
# sorting or reordering of the data. This simplify searching for information a lot. We had to do some small changes to 
# Drupal to get this working but it is worth it. You can find it all documented in astcore.module. 
# Thanks to Andreas for this exelent feature.
#
# Remember the Drupal version in wwwroot are now modified code.
#
# The Dial Timeout and Dial Parameters are now in Settings / System config. This allows you Easy to Configure how the DIAL 
# command in extensions.conf works. By Default we are using "|60|tTL("
# The agi scrips will now collect this parameters from the astsystem table.
