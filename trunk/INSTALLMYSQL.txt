How to install MySQL 5.0.15

mkdir -p /usr/local
cd /usr/local
# See http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html for exact download location
# They sometimes change it.
wget http://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/MySQL-5.0/mysql-standard-5.0.15-linux-i686.tar.gz/from/http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.mysql.com/

tar zxvf mysql-standard-5.0.15-linux-i686.tar.gz
groupadd mysql
useradd -g mysql mysql
ln -s /usr/local/mysql-standard-5.0.15-linux-i686 mysql
cd mysql

scripts/mysql_install_db --user=mysql

chown -R root .
chown -R mysql data
chgrp -R mysql .

Copy the correct my.cnf to the /etc/my.cnf for your system.
cp /usr/local/mysql/support-files/my-medium.cnf /etc/my.cnf

IMPORTANT: You have to change the following in the file: 
/etc/my.cnf

nano /etc/my.cnf

# Debian              /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
# Fedora and CentOS   /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock

[client]
# socket = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
socket = /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock

[mysqld]
# socket = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
socket = /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock

# Apache need access to mysql.sock or mysqld.sock
# Debian              /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
# Fedora and CentOS   /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock

mkdir -p /var/run/mysqld
mkdir -p /var/lib/mysql
chmod 777 -R /var/run/mysqld
chmod 777 -R /var/lib/mysql

to start MySQL:

cd /usr/local/mysql
bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &

To change the root Password:

bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'mysql_root_pw' 


To start mysqld at boot time you have to copy support-files/mysql.server
to the right place for your system.
on debian you can put it in /etc/init.d/ and run update-rc.d mysql.server defaults

Make sure MySQL 5 is running. 

IMPORTANT: If you are installing AstBill for the first time. We strongly recomend you call the database astbill. 
When you have it working you can change it to anything you want. 
This will clearly make it easier for you to get AstBill up and running fast and simple.
We get many support request due to people changing the database name and are unable to change it in all locations.

Create the AstBill database:
./mysqladmin create astbill -p
./mysql --user=root -p astbill < /home/astbill/database/astbill.sql
./mysql --user=root -p astbill < /home/astbill/database/astbill_proc.sql
