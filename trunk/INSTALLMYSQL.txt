Copy the correct my.cnf to the /etc/my.cnf for your system.
cp /usr/local/mysql/support-files/my-medium.cnf /etc/my.cnf

IMPORTANT: You have to change the following in the file: 
/etc/my.cnf

nano /etc/my.cnf

# Debian              /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
# Fedora and CentOS   /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock

[client]
# socket = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
socket = /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock

[mysqld]
# socket = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
socket = /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock

# Apache need access to mysql.sock or mysqld.sock
# Debian              /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
# Fedora and CentOS   /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock

mkdir -p /var/run/mysqld
mkdir -p /var/lib/mysql
chmod 777 -R /var/run/mysqld
chmod 777 -R /var/lib/mysql

to start MySQL:

cd /usr/local/mysql
bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &

To change the MySQL root Password:

bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'mysql_root_pw' 


To start mysqld at boot time you have to copy support-files/mysql.server
to the right place for your system.
on debian you can put it in /etc/init.d/ and run update-rc.d mysql.server defaults

Make sure MySQL 5 is running. 

IMPORTANT: If you are installing AstBill for the first time. We strongly recomend you call the database astbill. 
We also recomend you don't change the database user defined in astbill_proc.sql and /home/astbill/astbill.conf 
When you have AstBill working you can change it to anything you want. http://wiki.astbill.com/wiki/Change_database
This will clearly make it easier for you to get AstBill up and running fast and simple.
We get many support request due to people changing the database/user name and are unable to change it in all locations.

If you control your databases through a web-based control panel,
check its documentation, as the following instructions are for the
command line only.

Create the AstBill database:
./mysqladmin create astbill --user=root -p
./mysql --user=root -p astbill < /home/astbill/database/astbill.sql
./mysql --user=root -p astbill < /home/astbill/database/astbill_proc.sql
