Drupal - Version 4.6.3 (Included in the wwwroot directory of this AstBill Distribution)

3.0 - Installation Instructions:

First of all, make sure you have all the requirements set up properly.

3.1. Extract astbill-0.9.15.tar.bz2 to /home

cd /home
tar jxvf astbill-0.9.15.tar.bz2 

rename the directory astbill-0.9.15 to astbill

mv astbill-0.9.15 astbill
cd /home/astbill
chmod +x install.sh

IMPORTANT: Back up your files in the directory /etc/asterisk 
Run the install script. Run it from the AstBill Home Directory!

cd /home/astbill

./install.sh

Read INSTALLMYSQL.txt and Prepare MySQL 5 for AstBill.

You have to edit /etc/asterisk/res_mysql.conf for your OS.
You have to put the right path to mysql.sock. (See INSTALLMYSQL.txt. You need the same path as in /etc/my.cnf)

Ensure wwwroot of AstBill is visible for the Web Server

ln -s /home/astbill/wwwroot /var/www/html/astbill

Remember the files in the ajax directory have to be one level down from your web root. In a sub directory called ajax.
This is allready done if you are using AstBill's wwwroot

/home/astbill/astbill.conf contain MySQL username and passwords used for the PHP scrips in the ajax directory
and the Perl agi scrips in the /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/ directory.
You have to change this if you change the default mysql username and password. (highly recomended when your system is up and running)

Edit wwwroot/sites/default/settings.php and change the following variables.
(Use the search function of your editor to find the variables!)
example:
nano -w wwwroot/sites/default/settings.php

Make sure the $db_url line matches the database defined in the previous steps:

$db_url = "mysql://username:password@localhost/database";
where 'username', 'password', 'localhost' and 'database' are the
username, password, host and database name for your set up.

The correct example for this guide is :
$db_url = 'mysql://astbilluser:astbill419@localhost/astbill';

Make sure $db_prefix is set to pbx_ or AstBill will NOT WORK!
$db_prefix = 'pbx_';

Set $base_url to the URL of your AstBill main page, with no trailing slash.
$base_url = 'http://127.0.0.1/astbill';

3.5. Test your installation
Go to the url where you have installed drupal
Example http://127.0.0.1/astbill
You should get a login box and a default blue theme with a AstBill logo.

An admin account is already set up.
username: astbill
password: demoastbill

There is no need to download Drupal. Drupal is included in the directory wwwroot

Apache

Make sure to edit /etc/php4/apache2/php.ini and check that

extension=mysql.so
extension=gd.so

You can find them commented under this section, if not just add the above lines.
