im thinking in the peering stuff. 
say i give portal (tenant) to a provider in a different country.. 
they give same in return but i need to have setting to set a route
system to allow there clients to route via there routes and still
have all other from my clients routing via default routes
  
yes think it work well when sharing routes like untimmed calls etc


IN PROGRESS

oh and can you please post a reply to my posting saying the installation team donation 
system is approved and all installations should use this service

I have changed the pricing system compleetly
I have a programmer making the web interface now. It will be ready in a weeks time
we use what we call ccn - Charge Code Number

The idea is to have the dialing pattern compleetly seperated from the price list and rateplan
ok you know what would be good
it is a bit complex with 5 tables
but it is very good
to have route available per tenant..
as maintaining price lists are so much easeri
so you can set route per tenant
The route is when we dial out. This is just for the call cost.
I have not implemented it in the dialing route yet.
but it makes it very easy to have a price list for each tenant and you dont need to maintain all the dialing patterns for each price list

That is a good point

I think so
The consept of the CCN numbers is taken from one of the largest telecoms in Scandinavia. It is very efficient.
You only have to maintain the dial/price patterns for all the countries in one table.
thats sound sbetter
all your prices and rateplans will be independent
yes i think thats a better way to manage things
in away what we have has rateplan and pricelist seperate
Dialing patterns hardly changes and if they change it is for all the rateplans
true


we also need to address failovers for when a carrier returns congested


Add reporttitle to report table astreport

) find the product & business model that maximizes that natural rate, 
and 2) execute on removing whatever are the natural limiters to that 
growth rate. Limiters are the scalable part of that natural growth rate. 
For example, once you have the right product and know the right sales 
pitch, the limiter may be finding the right people to hear the pitch 
(e.g. sales leads). Or, if you have the right product, right sales pitch, 
and know the target customers, the limiter may be how fast you can hire 
and train the sales people to deliver the right pitch. 
The limiters in software business are typically leads or 
sales people. The limiters in a services business are typically 
the ability to deliver on the services (hiring and training the 
services delivery people).

Every business is different, but returning to our theme of Open Source, I have some observations common to many Open Source businesses on revenue growth rates. First, most such businesses use Open Source as a lead generation and demand creation mechanism. They use Open Source to create customer pull for their commercial offering, whether it’s a service and support offering, or a commercial product offering. This is in contrast to a push model which relies on a sales force (or channel) to introduce (“push”) your software to customers. Push and pull models have very different operating characteristics; that is, they have very different cost structures and revenue growth profiles.

I believe that one of the benefits of Open Source models is the ability to create customer pull at low cost. (The changing environment around software development and the software marketplace that has enabled this is a topic I hope to spend some time discussing in the near future.) However, along with that pull model is a delayed (or deferred) revenue growth ramp. Pull in an Open Source model is typically created through widespread adoption and usage of your software. Once the software is widely used, natural customer segments begin to appear. For example, customers that want insurance, indemnification, support, enhanced features, etc. But all those requests from users (pull) depend on their adoption of the software. So the initial focus of an Open source model needs to be customer adoption. And what drives customer adoption of Open source software? A quality product.


Printing Welcome Letters
Click on the Tools icon and select the Welcome Letters icon. 
This will print a simple welcome letter for new customers that can be mailed. 
It has a summary of the services they signed up for included. 
    
New Billing Types require:
# Frequency: This is the frequency in months that this billing type is billed. For example a billing type of Yearly Invoice would have a frequency of 12, where a billing type of Monthly Invoice would have a frequency of 1. One time billing types for free accounts or single purchase types would have a frequency of 0
# Method: This is the method category for the billing type, creditcard, invoice, prepay, or free. This method determins what billing tool will create the bill for this billing type. 

Frequency: Services and Billing Types both have frequencies. Frequencies are numbers of months that the service or account is billed for at one time. Each service has a billing frequency. Lets say you want to offer a service for 4.95 per month, then you make a new service with a price of 4.95 and a frequency of 1. If the customer has a billing type with a frequency of 3, it would multiply that monthly cost times 3 and get the resulting cost for that quarterly invoice, 14.85. If the customer billing type is monthly then it will just have 1x1 and give you 4.95 as the cost for that billing type. You can use this to create services that are billed at more than monthly frequencies by making the frequency for example 6. Then that service and price will be billed every 6 months.
